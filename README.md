# Laptop Rehab Project

This repository contains the templates, configuration files, automation
scripts, documentation, and other artifacts associated with the Laptop Rehab
volunteer project.

Our goal is to "rehabilitate" old laptops for use by school children who
otherwise have little to no access to technology.
